<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Structural Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Supported Structures</li><li>Air-Inflated Structures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic structural systems encompass two main types: air-supported structures and air-inflated structures. Air-supported structures rely on a constant air pressure to maintain their shape and stability, often used for temporary facilities like sports arenas or exhibition halls. In contrast, air-inflated structures utilize a sealed air chamber, creating a rigid form that can endure varying pressures, making them suitable for long-term applications like warehouse spaces or industrial buildings. Both systems offer lightweight, cost-effective solutions with quick installation times.</p></p>
