<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Exhaust Pyrometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital exhaust pyrometer market is divided into two primary types: contact and non-contact pyrometers. Contact pyrometers measure temperature by directly touching the surface of the exhaust, providing precise readings but potentially risking damage or contamination. In contrast, non-contact pyrometers utilize infrared technology to gauge temperatures from a distance, making them ideal for applications where access to the exhaust is limited or where contamination is a concern. Both types serve critical roles in monitoring and optimizing thermal processes.</p></p>
