<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Volutes Twin Screw Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sealed Twin-Screw Pumps</li><li>Non-sealed Twin-Screw Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Double Volutes Twin Screw Pump market is categorized into two main types: sealed and non-sealed twin-screw pumps. Sealed twin-screw pumps are designed to operate with containment systems that prevent leakage, making them suitable for handling hazardous or sensitive fluids. Non-sealed twin-screw pumps, on the other hand, lack such containment, making them ideal for less critical applications where leakage is not a concern. Both types offer efficient fluid transfer, but their selection depends on the specific application requirements and environmental considerations.</p></p>
