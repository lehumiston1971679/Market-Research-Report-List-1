<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Assist Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)</li><li>Intra-aortic Balloon Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Assist Devices are medical devices that support heart function in patients with severe heart conditions. The Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) is a mechanical pump that helps the heart pump blood, often used in heart failure patients awaiting transplant or those who are not candidates for surgery. The Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) aids in improving blood flow and reducing the heart's workload by inflating and deflating a balloon in the aorta, thus enhancing cardiac output during critical situations.</p></p>
