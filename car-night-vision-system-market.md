<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Night Vision System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Infrared Night Vision System</li><li>Passive Infrared Night Vision System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Car Night Vision System market includes two main types: Active Infrared Night Vision System and Passive Infrared Night Vision System. Active systems use infrared light sources to illuminate the road, capturing reflected light to create a clear image in low-light conditions. Passive systems rely on detecting thermal radiation emitted by objects, providing visibility without additional light sources. Both enhance driver safety by improving visibility in darkness, but active systems are better for short-range clarity, while passive systems excel in long-range detection.</p></p>
