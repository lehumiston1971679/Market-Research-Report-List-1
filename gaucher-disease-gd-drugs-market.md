<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gaucher Disease (GD) Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enzyme Replacement Therapy</li><li>Substrate Reduction Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Gaucher Disease drugs market primarily consists of two treatment types: Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT). ERT involves administering a synthetic form of the deficient enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. In contrast, SRT aims to reduce the production of glucocerebroside, the substrate that accumulates in patients, thus mitigating disease progression. Both therapies provide crucial options for managing Gaucher Disease, addressing specific patient needs and enhancing quality of life.</p></p>
