<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney Dialysis Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis (HD)</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The kidney dialysis device market encompasses two main types: Hemodialysis (HD) and Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis involves filtering blood through an external machine, effectively removing toxins and excess fluids, typically performed in clinical settings. In contrast, Peritoneal Dialysis utilizes the patient's abdominal lining as a filter, allowing for at-home treatment through a sterile solution infused into the abdomen. Both methods cater to patients with kidney failure, offering different approaches to managing the disease and improving quality of life.</p></p>
